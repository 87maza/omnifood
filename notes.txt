look for webforms (input:valid/invalid/required/optional/out of range)
content-editable = its a text attribute that allows you to change and edit and will change the DOM but not save it

Structural Selectors:
Assuming global
:first-of-type = body is automatically the first of its type within its parent
:first-child = first child of every div
body:last-child = last child of every div
body:last-of-type = starting for the bottom of the div, the last type, looks bottom-up
//for performance reasons, first of type is better than last of type
:only-child matches the divs is 1 element
body:only-of-type = matches only 1 type of every div
:nth-child(3n) = n starts at 0 and increments up (3n-1) 2,5,8,11,14,17
